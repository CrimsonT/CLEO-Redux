If you run The Definitive Edition (GTA III, VC, or SA):

- [Follow this guide](the-definitive-edition-faq.md#how-to-install-cleo-redux-in-the-definitive-edition).

For all other games:

- Copy `cleo_redux.asi` to the game directory.

- Run the game

Plugins for CLEO Redux (`*.cleo`) should be copied to the `CLEO\CLEO_PLUGINS` directory.

Note: CLEO Redux does not alter any game files. It exploits the fact that the game natively loads `.asi` files as addons to the Miles Sound System library. No extra software is required.
