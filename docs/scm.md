# SCM

CLEO Redux can execute scripts compiled into the game's native binary SCM format. Such scripts have a `.cs` extension.

Use [Sanny Builder 3](https://sannybuilder.com) in GTA III, GTA VC or GTA SA edit modes respectively. Check out [this page](https://cleo.li/scripts.html) for more information.
