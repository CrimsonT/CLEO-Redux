There could be a noticeable lag during the first game run as CLEO Redux downloads the files necessary for [JavaScript support](#javascript-support). It won't happen on subsequent runs.

A new folder named `CLEO` should appear in the game directory. This is the primary location for all CLEO scripts, plugins and configs.

{{#include ./cleo-directory-note.md}}
