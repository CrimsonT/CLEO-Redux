During the first game run CLEO Redux downloads extra files necessary for [JavaScript support](./prerequisites.md). It doesn't happen on subsequent runs.

After that a new folder named `CLEO` should appear in the game directory. This is the primary location for all CLEO scripts, plugins and configs.

{{#include ./cleo-directory-note.md}}
