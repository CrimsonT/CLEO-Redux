# Introduction

CLEO Redux is an [embeddable](./embedding.md) and [extensible](./using-sdk.md) JavaScript runtime capable of running user-made scripts in games and desktop applications. It is inspired by [CLEO Library](https://cleo.li/) and is [partially compatible](./relation-to-cleo-library.md) with its scripts and plugins.
