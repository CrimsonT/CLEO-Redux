# Rust SDK

Rust SDK uses similar to C++ interface with some extra wrapping methods to allow easily convert between C and Rust types. The header file is available as a [crate](https://crates.io/crates/cleo_redux_sdk) on crates.io. See the documentation [here](https://docs.rs/cleo_redux_sdk/latest/).

## Example

See the `Input` plugin. It adds a bunch of new commands to check or emulate keyboard and mouse input.
