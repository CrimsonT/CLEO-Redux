# CLEO Directory

CLEO directory is the primary location where you install [CLEO scripts](./installation-scripts.md), [CLEO plugins](./installation-plugins.md) and [custom texts](./using-fxt.md). CLEO Redux automatically creates this folder when the game starts. 

In most cases this directory can be found in the same folder where you put `cleo_redux.asi`. If, however, CLEO lacks write permissions there and fails to create new files, it uses an alternate path at `C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\CLEO Redux`. `cleo_redux.log` and the `CLEO` directory can be found there.
