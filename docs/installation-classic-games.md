- Copy `cleo_redux.asi` to the game directory (with the main executable file).

- Run the game

You should get a new CLEO directory created in the same directory.

Note: CLEO Redux does not alter any game files. It exploits the fact that the game natively loads `.asi` files as addons to the Miles Sound System library. No extra software is required.
