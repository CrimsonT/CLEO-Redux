# JavaScript

CLEO Redux targets JavaScript as the primary language for custom scripts. JavaScript is a popular programming language with rich ecosystem and plenty of available information. It's free from SCM language limits and pitfalls such as lack of support for functions, arrays, or the low number of variables.

To make a JS script use VS Code (recommended) or any editor of your choice. Create a new file with `.js` extension and put it in the CLEO folder. See [JavaScript support](#javascript-support) for extra information.

The runtime supports [ECMAScript 2020 standard](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/). It means you are able to use the most recent JavaScript features out of the box, such as imports, classes, arrow functions, etc.

> CLEO Redux is not Node.js. Don't expect sockets, file system operations or other Node.js features to be available here.
