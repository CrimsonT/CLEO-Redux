### 0.6.0 - Oct 08, 2021

- add [INT_ADD](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/gta3/CLEO/0A8E), [INT_SUB](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/gta3/CLEO/0A8F), [INT_MUL](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/gta3/CLEO/0A90), [INT_DIV](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/gta3/CLEO/0A91) commands
- math operations are now available through the native JavaScript `Math` object where possible ([see documentation](using-math.md)).
- new static methods in `Memory` class. See [documentation](using-memory.md) for more info

#### BREAKING CHANGES
- `asFloat` has been removed in favor of `Memory.toFloat`
- class `Object` has been renamed to `ScriptObject` to avoid conflicts with native JavaScript Object.
- deprecated command `isKeyPressed` has been deleted. Use `Pad.isKeyPressed` instead

### 0.5.3 - Oct 02, 2021

- add a new built-in JavaScript function `asFloat` to cast an integer value returned by the `Memory.Read` command to a floating point number ([IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754))

```js
var gravity = asFloat(Memory.Read(gravityAddress, 4, false)); // the gravity var now holds a floating-point value
```

- auto-generated `*.d.ts` files now make a distinction between integer and floating-point parameters, VS Code autocomplete now displays them with `int` and `float` types respectively
- auto-generated `*.d.ts` files now have `<reference no-default-lib="true"/>` so it is no longer needed to add this line in a script file to exclude unsupported JS commands from autocomplete
- fix: `op` incorrectly returned any single value as integer regardless of the type information
- fix: `showTextBox` command was missing in the `cleo.log` with `logOpcodes=1`

### 0.5.2 - Sep 30, 2021

### 0.5.1 - Sep 28, 2021

- add support for `Boolean`, `null` and `undefined` as arguments of the `op` command
- allow arbitrary size in `0A8C WRITE_MEMORY` to fill a continiuos block of memory with a single byte value
- fix: after reloading the game JS scripts could have been duplicated

### 0.5.0 - Sep 25, 2021
