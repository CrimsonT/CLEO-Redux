# Введение
 
CLEO Redux is a scripting runtime for the GTA 3D era games. It is a proud member of the CLEO family and provides familiar experience to anyone who used original CLEO Library for the classic GTA San Andreas or its re-implementations for other games. The main goal of CLEO is to provide a way to easily customize the game with countless user-made scripts.
